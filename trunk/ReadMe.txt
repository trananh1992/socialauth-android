WELCOME to SocialAuth Android SDK version 2.5
===============================================================================

The SDK contains all the material you need to use SocialAuth Android project.
The directories are as follows:

1. libs - This contains socialauth-android-2.5.jar and socialauth-4.1.jar. You need 
to include both of these in your application. The socialauth-4.1.jar is the 
underlying OAuth infrastructure and the socialauth-android.jar has the Android 
components.

2. assets - Contains the icons for facebook, twitter, linkedin and other providers which 
you can add to your project. You may also decide to use your own icons in which case
this is not needed.

3. src - This contains the entire socialauth-android-2.5 Eclipse project if you
would like to debug or you need to make some changes. Most of the time you
should not need to.

4. examples - This contains three examples that we have built for you showing
how the SDK can be used to build a Share button, Share bar or a completely
custom UI.
